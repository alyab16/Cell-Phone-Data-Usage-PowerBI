# Cell-Phone-Data-Usage-PowerBI

**Project's Goals**: The primary objective of the project was to manage and optimize the cell phone usage of the company's full-time employees. This involved monitoring various aspects such as local and international call minutes, text, and data usage across all levels of the organization.

**Solution**: A Python-based data consolidation system was developed to gather and process the cell phone usage data. This consolidated data was then utilized to build a comprehensive Power BI report. The report provided a detailed overview of cell phone usage by every employee, department, team, and employment level, from junior employees to directors.

**Impact**: The Power BI report enabled the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to identify certain employees that were excessively using the provided services for personal purposes. This crucial information allowed the CFO to take appropriate actions, leading to significant cost savings and improved resource allocation within the company. The project, therefore, had a substantial positive impact on the company's operational efficiency and cost management.

**Note:** In adherence to the companyâ€™s privacy policies, the data files and the Power BI report are not provided in this repository. Furthermore, the data presented has been altered to ensure the actual values are not disclosed.
